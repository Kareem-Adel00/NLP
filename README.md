## **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**

ðŸš€ **Excited to Share My Latest Project on Twitter Sentiment Analysis!** ðŸš€

I've been working on an exciting entity-level sentiment analysis project using a Twitter dataset, and I'm thrilled to share the results with you all! ðŸŽ‰

**Project Overview:**
The goal of this project was to analyze Twitter messages and determine the sentiment towards specific entities. The dataset includes three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. We treat irrelevant messages as Neutral.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled tasks such as text normalization, HTML tag removal, URL removal, tokenization, stopword removal, and more.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transformed the text data into numerical vectors to feed into the model.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Utilized this powerful classifier to achieve impressive accuracy in sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation:** Achieved promising results with detailed confusion matrix and classification reports.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, nltk, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, wordcloud
- **Model:** RandomForestClassifier
